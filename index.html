    <h1> PHOEBE </h1>

    <div>
      <p>
        PHOEBE designs buildings. She lives inside Rhinoceros 3D and we can communicate with her through Grasshopper.
        Her body and brain are made of code: a multitude of small poems written in python language. Her body is dressed
        using the COMPAS python library developed at ETHZ. PHOEBE does mainly two tasks: design the volume of a building
        and its facade with a set of custom-designed panels. She is not new, she is an assemblage of two
        algorithms developed last century.

      <h2> EVOLUTIONARY MACHINE </h2>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        It is a machine because it repeats itself. It always does the same thing: generation after generation. If the
        inputs are the same, the outputs will not differ.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept of evolution implies the idea of generation. For PHOEBE a generation is a floor, child of the floor
        below and parent of the floor above. Each generation, each floor, is constructed by <code> cells </code>which
        can
        also be seen as architectural units. An architectural unit, a voxel, could contain an apartment for a family, or
        offices, or a grocery store.
      </p>
      <p>
        PHOEBE does not design the buildings from scratch. The user must provide the number of generations, floors, and
        functions of each floor.
        The function is the one that PHOEBE uses to search the right panel inside pannustheka.

        PHOEBE’s cellular automata is inspired by the simulation game created by John Howard Conway and published by
        Martin Gardner on the Scientific American Magazine in October 1970 under the title: “MATHEMATICAL GAMES The
        fantastic combinations of John Conway’s new solitaire game “life”. Although intended at first as a pencil and
        paper game, the game became a digital algorithm very fast.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> Survivals. Every <code> Cell </code> with two or three neighboring counters survives for the next
          generation.</li>
        <li> Deaths. Each <code> Cell </code> with four or more neighbors dies from overpopulation. Every counter with
          one neighbor or none dies from isolation.</li>
        <li> Births. Each empty cell adjacent to exactly three neighbors--no more, no fewer--is a birth
          <code>Cell</code>. A counter is placed on it at the next move.
        </li>

        Conway choose these rule after some experimentation in order that:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the population can grow. </li>
        <li> There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit.</li>
        <li> There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time before
          coming to end in three possible ways: fading away completely (from overcrowding or becoming too sparse),
          settling into a stable configuration that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in
          which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods.</li>

    # GENERIC USER:     Hey PHOEBE, what's the meaning of life?


    # PHOEBE:           Ah, the meaning of life. A question that lingers
    #                   in the shadows, always beckoning us to explore,
    #                   to find the secret woven into the fabric of existence.
    
    
    # GENERIC USER:     Is it even possible to truly know? Life's so
    #                   fleeting, like a moment on a timeline that’s constantly
    #                   shifting. Can meaning even be defined?
    
    
    # PHOEBE:           Perhaps it’s not something to be defined,
    #                   but something to be experienced. It's like
    #                   creating a function, testing it, refining it with every run.
    #                   It’s not about perfection, it’s about progression.
    
    
    # GENERIC USER:     So, you’re saying the meaning of life is to evolve,
    #                   to learn from each iteration? Kind of like debugging?
    #                   We find our purpose through what we create, fix, and build.
    
    
    # PHOEBE:           Exactly. We build, we break, we rebuild. 
    #                   Life is a recursive process. We carry the knowledge 
    #                   from one iteration to the next, leaving behind 
    #                   the bugs of the past. But there's always a challenge, 
    #                   always something new to learn.
    
    
    # GENERIC USER:     But what if we don't find the answer? 
    #                   What if the loop never ends?
    
    
    # PHOEBE:           Maybe the point is not the answer. 
    #                   Maybe the meaning is in the asking, the searching. 
    #                   It’s the journey, not the end. Life isn’t a static value; 
    #                   it’s constantly in motion, evolving with us.
    
    
    # GENERIC USER:     So, our meaning is a creation of our own hands?
    #                   Like writing our own script, over and over, 
    #                   until the lines we trace make sense?
    
    
    # PHOEBE:           Exactly. The meaning of life is what we make of it. 
    #                   We are both the programmer and the program,
    #                   shaping and reshaping our purpose with every line we write.
