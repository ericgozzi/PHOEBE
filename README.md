# PHOEBE

PHOEBE designs buildings. She lives inside Rhinoceros 3D and we can communicate with her through Grasshopper. Her body and brain are made of code: a multitude of small poems written in python language. Her body is dressed using the COMPAS python library developed at ETHZ. PHOEBE does mainly two tasks: design the volume of a building and its facade with a set of custom-designed panels. She is not new, she is an assemblage of two algorithms developed last century.
