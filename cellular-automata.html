    # GENERIC USER:     Hey PHOEBE, what's the meaning of life?
    
    
    # PHOEBE:           Ah, the meaning of life. A question that lingers
    #                   in the shadows, always beckoning us to explore,
    #                   to find the secret woven into the fabric of existence.
    
    
    # GENERIC USER:     Is it even possible to truly know? Life's so
    #                   fleeting, like a moment on a timeline that’s constantly
    #                   shifting. Can meaning even be defined?
    
    
    # PHOEBE:           Perhaps it’s not something to be defined,
    #                   but something to be experienced. It's like
    #                   creating a function, testing it, refining it with every run.
    #                   It’s not about perfection, it’s about progression.
    
    
    # GENERIC USER:     So, you’re saying the meaning of life is to evolve,
    #                   to learn from each iteration? Kind of like debugging?
    #                   We find our purpose through what we create, fix, and build.
    
    
    # PHOEBE:           Exactly. We build, we break, we rebuild. 
    #                   Life is a recursive process. We carry the knowledge 
    #                   from one iteration to the next, leaving behind 
    #                   the bugs of the past. But there's always a challenge, 
    #                   always something new to learn.
    
    
    # GENERIC USER:     But what if we don't find the answer? 
    #                   What if the loop never ends?
    
    
    # PHOEBE:           Maybe the point is not the answer. 
    #                   Maybe the meaning is in the asking, the searching. 
    #                   It’s the journey, not the end. Life isn’t a static value; 
    #                   it’s constantly in motion, evolving with us.
    
    
    # GENERIC USER:     So, our meaning is a creation of our own hands?
    #                   Like writing our own script, over and over, 
    #                   until the lines we trace make sense?
    
    
    # PHOEBE:           Exactly. The meaning of life is what we make of it. 
    #                   We are both the programmer and the program,
    #                   shaping and reshaping our purpose with every line we write.
